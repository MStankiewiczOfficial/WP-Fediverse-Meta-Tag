# Fediverse Meta Tag

The "Fediverse Meta Tag" plugin adds a custom meta tag `fediverse:creator` to posts on your WordPress blog. It allows you to associate a Fediverse user identifier (e.g., Mastodon) with a specific post, making it easier for other platforms to identify the content creator within the Fediverse social networks.

The first site that uses the plugin is [fossgralnia.pl](https://fossgralnia.pl) - on it you can see how it works!

## Features

- Adds a metadata field to the post editor for entering the `fediverse:creator` tag.
- Automatically assigns a default tag for posts based on the author's username if the field is empty.
- For pages and other post types, assigns a static `fediverse:creator` tag.

## Customization

You can customize the default Fediverse handles assigned to specific users in the plugin code. Change `user1@example.com` and `user2@example.com` to the appropriate Fediverse handles, and also set the default handles for posts.
